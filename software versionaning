 🧠 1️⃣ Introduction to Software Versioning

 👉 Simple meaning

Software versioning = giving numbers to software when it changes.

Whenever developers:

 add feature
 fix bug
 improve speed

→ version number changes.

This helps everyone know which software is latest and what changed.

 🏠 Easy analogy (School notebook)

You write notes in notebook.

Day 1 → first notes → Version 1
Day 2 → add more → Version 2
Day 3 → correct mistakes → Version 3

Notebook same, but improving.

Software also improves like this → version changes.

 💻 Real-time example (company)

In company:

```
Bank app created → Version 1.0
Add payment option → Version 2.0
Fix login bug → Version 2.1

Without version → nobody knows what changed.
With version → easy tracking.
