Consider every subsequence of an array of integers. 
• Sort the subsequence in increasing order. 
• Determine the sum of differences of elements in the subsequence. 
• Return the length of the longest subsequence where this sum is even. 
Example 
Given n = 4 elements and arr = [2, 4, 1, 7], these are some of the subsequences. 
Subsequence 
Sum of diff of 
Sorted Subsequence 
[2, 4, 1] 
[1, 2, 4] 
Adjacent elements  
1 + 2 = 3 (Odd) 
[2, 1, 7] 
[1, 2, 7] 
1 + 5 = 6 (Even) 
[2, 4, 1, 7] 
[1, 2, 4, 7] 
1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (Even) 
[2, 1] 
[1, 2] 
1 (Odd) 
We can see that the maximum possible length of a valid subsequence is 4. 
Function Description 
Complete the function findLongestSubsequence in the editor below. 
f
indLongestSubsequence has the following parameter(s): 
int arr[n]:  an array of integers 
Returns 
int: the length of the longest subsequence as described 
Constraints 
• 3 ≤ n ≤ 105 
• 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109 
Input Format For Custom Testing 
The first line contains an integer, n, the number of elements in arr. 
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains an integer, arr[i].

Explanation 
Consider the subsequence [5, 6, 2, 3, 2, 4]. 
• arrange the subsequence in ascending order, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
• the differences are 0,1,1,1,1 
• 0+1+1+1+1 = 4 
Sample Case 1

Sample Output 
4 
Explanation 
The entire array can be used. 
• arrange the subsequence in ascending order, 1,3,5,7 
• the adjacent differences are 2, 2, 2 
• 2+2+2 = 6
