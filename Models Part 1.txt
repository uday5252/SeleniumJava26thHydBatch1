  1. History of Traditional Software Development Model

 What is “Traditional Software Development”?

These are the models used before Agile existed (before 2001).
They follow strict step-by-step phases → Requirements → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment.

 Why did they exist?

Because earlier software projects were similar to construction projects — slow, predictable, and not frequently changing.

---

  Simple Analogy (Best One):

Think of building a house in the 1990s:

1. First collect requirements from the family
2. Make blueprint
3. Start construction
4. Paint
5. Handover

You cannot:

 Change the number of rooms midway
 Move the bathroom after construction
 Change colors after painting

Software was also like this → no frequent changes.

---

  Real-Time Example:

 Example 1: Banking software in the 1990s

Banks knew exactly what they wanted:

 Passbook printing
 Fixed deposit module
 Loan interest calculation
  Very stable and predictable.

 Example 2: Railway reservation system

Requirements rarely changed.
No UI updates, no new features every week.

---

  Why Traditional Models Emerged?

 Projects were big and slow
 Businesses did not change quickly
 Users were not demanding
 Internet apps were not there
 Requirements were stable for years

---

2. Software Development Model & SDLC

 What is SDLC?

Software Development Life Cycle:
A step-by-step process followed to build software from idea → delivery → maintenance.

 SDLC Phases:

1. Requirement gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

---

  SDLC Simple Analogy:

Cooking Biryani

1. Requirements → What type of biryani?
2. Analysis → Ingredients needed
3. Design → How to cook (recipe)
4. Development → Cooking
5. Testing → Taste
6. Deployment → Serve
7. Maintenance → Reheat, leftover storage

---

  Real-Time Example:

 Example 1: Building a Hospital Management System

 Requirements – what departments? OPD, billing, pharmacy
 Analysis – how many tables? patient, doctor, billing
 Design – ER diagrams, architecture
 Development – actual coding
 Testing – check OPD flow, billing accuracy
 Deployment – install in hospital
 Maintenance – bug fixes, adding new feature

---

---

  3. “Waterfall Model” – An Overview

Waterfall is the oldest, strictest SDLC model.
It moves downward like a waterfall → one direction → no going back.

---

  Waterfall Phases

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation (Coding)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

---

  Key Rules of Waterfall

✔ One phase must be completed fully before next phase starts
✔ No overlap
✔ Very difficult to go back
✔ Works only when requirements are clear and not changing

---

 Simple Analogy
Think of writing an exam on paper:

 Once you submit, you can’t erase and rewrite
 Whatever you wrote is final
  This is how Waterfall works.

---

  Real-Time Example

 Example 1: Military systems

You cannot change missile guidance software every week.

 Example 2: Government systems

Projects like Aadhar, voter ID, passport — requirements are strict and approved by law.

---

---

  4. Waterfall or Sequential-Based Development Model

This is Waterfall’s technical definition.

  Why is it called Sequential?

Because steps happen one after the other → sequential.

No parallel work
No iteration
No flexibility

---

  Sequential Model Analogy

Think of manufacturing a car in a factory:

1. Chassis
2. Engine
3. Body
4. Painting
5. Delivery

You can’t paint before building the body.
You can’t install engine after delivery.

Same rigid sequence → Waterfall.

---

  Sequential Model – Where It Works Best

✔ Banking core systems
✔ Medical equipment software
✔ Government contract projects

Because these have:

 Minimal UI changes
 Stable requirements
 Heavy documentation
 Very strict compliance rules

---

---

  5. “Real Life” – Waterfall Model (Best Real-Life Examples)

Here are multiple real-life examples to understand Waterfall deeply:

---

  Real-Life Example 1: Building a Flyover

Steps never change:

1. Survey
2. Plan
3. Design
4. Build pillars
5. Build bridge
6. Road laying
7. Inauguration

If the design is wrong, you cannot break flyover and start again.

This is exactly Waterfall.

---

  Real-Life Example 2: Manufacturing iPhones

Apple does not change the iPhone’s design after manufacturing starts.

Once blueprint is approved:

 Factories follow strict process
 No redesign allowed
 High documentation

---

  Real-Life Example 3: Designing a Train Engine

You cannot change design mid-way.
You cannot rebuild everything if requirement changes.

---

  Real-Life Example 4: Passport System in Early 2000s

 Requirements approved by ministry
 Coding based on fixed SRS
 Changes require years
  Very slow but structured.

---

  Real-Life IT Example: Banking Loan Processing System

1. Requirements

    Interest rules
    EMI formula
    RBI guidelines
2. Design
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Production
   Changes only after 6–12 months.

 🌟 1. WHY AGILE? — Analogy + Real-Time Example

  Analogy

Agile is like cooking chapatis one by one instead of cooking 50 together.

 You cook one
 Taste
 Adjust salt or softness
 Then cook next

This ensures:
✔ better quality
✔ fast corrections
✔ no waste
✔ continuous improvement

  Real-Time Example

Swiggy or Zomato:

 Releases new features every week
 Tries small UI changes
 Gathers user feedback
 Improves next sprint

This is Agile in action.

---

 🌟 2. AGILE MANIFESTO – Analogies + Real Examples

 ✔ Value 1: Individuals & Interactions OVER Processes & Tools

 Analogy:

Talking to your friend directly is faster than sending long emails.

 Real Example:

Developers in Daily Standup quickly clear doubts instead of waiting for documents.

---

 ✔ Value 2: Working Software OVER Comprehensive Documentation

 Analogy:

Testing a working car is better than reading a 200-page manual about that car.

 Real Example:

Amazon shows working prototype of new dashboard instead of sending documents.

---

 ✔ Value 3: Customer Collaboration OVER Contract Negotiation

 Analogy:

Building a house while taking frequent feedback from the owner, not only at the end.

 Real Example:

Client attends every Sprint Review to check progress and give changes.

---

 ✔ Value 4: Responding to Change OVER Following a Plan

 Analogy:

If rain starts during a cricket match, teams change strategy instantly.

 Real Example:

Netflix changes its homepage design for festivals even if it was not in original plan.

---

---

 🌟 3. THE 12 AGILE PRINCIPLES — Analogy + Real-Time Example for EACH

---

 Principle 1: Early and continuous delivery of valuable software

 Analogy:

Serving snacks before full meal — keeps customer happy and reduces waiting.

 Real Example:

YouTube releases one feature (Shorts), then improves it every sprint.

---

 Principle 2: Welcome changing requirements, even late

 Analogy:

If your mother says “add more sugar” while making tea, you can still adjust.

 Real Example:

Zomato adds “Festival Offers” at the last moment based on market trends.

---

 Principle 3: Deliver working software frequently (short cycles)

 Analogy:

Getting salary monthly is better than getting salary once a year.

 Real Example:

Swiggy pushes app updates every 1–2 weeks.

---

 Principle 4: Business & developers work together daily

 Analogy:

A doctor and nurse coordinating daily ensures proper patient care.

 Real Example:

Product Owner and developers discuss acceptance criteria daily in standups.

---

 Principle 5: Build projects around motivated individuals

 Analogy:

A motivated student learns faster than a forced student.

 Real Example:

Companies hire passionate developers for hackathons → results are amazing.

---

 Principle 6: Face-to-face communication is most effective

 Analogy:

Talking directly is faster than texting or emailing.

 Real Example:

Developers clarify requirements by quick video calls instead of long mail threads.

---

 Principle 7: Working software is the primary measure of progress

 Analogy:

In cooking, only eating the dish proves it’s ready — not reading the recipe.

 Real Example:

An app feature demo is more important than the 20-page requirement document.

---

 Principle 8: Sustainable development

 Analogy:

Running at constant speed wins marathon—not sprinting then collapsing.

 Real Example:

Agile teams avoid overtime; they maintain stable pace for every sprint.

---

 Principle 9: Continuous attention to technical excellence

 Analogy:

Regularly sharpening your knife makes cooking easier.

 Real Example:

Developers do refactoring and code reviews to prevent technical debt.

---

 Principle 10: Simplicity — maximize work not done

 Analogy:

Using a bucket instead of a shower to save water — simple and effective.

 Real Example:

Don’t build unnecessary features like “Chat” in a food app if users don’t need it.

---

 Principle 11: Self-organizing teams produce best results

 Analogy:

A cricket team on the ground takes its own decisions—not waiting for coach every ball.

 Real Example:

Agile teams decide how to build and divide tasks without a manager dictating everything.

---

 Principle 12: Regular reflection (Retrospective)

 Analogy:

Reviewing your monthly expenses → improve next month.

 Real Example:

In Sprint Retrospective:

 What went well?
 What went wrong?
 How to improve next sprint?

This improves team quality continuously.
