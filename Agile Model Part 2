 🔵 Introduction to Agile Testing

 1️⃣ What is Agile Testing?

 👉 Simple meaning

Agile testing = Testing happens along with development, not after development.

Old method:
Build full house → then check problems
Agile:
Build room by room → check each room immediately

 👉 Real-time example

Swiggy app team:

 Developer builds login feature today
 Tester tests login same day
 Bug fixed immediately

Not wait for 3 months.

EXAMPLE

Wife cooking biryani 🍗
Husband waits till end → says salt less 😡
Wife: “Why didn’t you tell while cooking?”

Agile testing =
Husband tasting while cooking 😎

---

 2️⃣ Agile Team – Roles and Activities

 👨‍💻 Roles in Agile team

 Product Owner → tells what to build
 Scrum Master → manages process
 Developer → writes code
 Tester → tests
 DevOps → deployment

 👉 Activity flow

Plan → Develop → Test → Fix → Deploy → Repeat

All work together daily.

EXAMPLE

Family trip planning:

 Wife = Product owner (decides Goa)
 Husband = Developer (drives car)
 Kid = Tester (keeps complaining)
 Google Maps = Scrum master 🤣

---

 3️⃣ Where does Tester fit in Agile Team?

👉 Tester is NOT last person
Tester is involved from day 1

Before coding → tester reads requirement
During coding → tester discusses with dev
After coding → tester tests immediately

Tester = part of development team

EXAMPLE

Before buying sofa:

 Wife selects
 Husband pays
 Tester friend sits & checks comfort 😆

Tester must sit before buying!

---

 4️⃣ Tester Role & Responsibilities in Agile

 🧪 Tester work

 Understand requirement
 Write test cases
 Test daily builds
 Report bugs in JIRA
 Attend standup meeting
 Do regression testing
 Automation testing

 👉 Real-time example

Amazon cart feature release:
Tester checks:

 Add to cart
 Remove
 Payment
 Offers
 Performance

EXAMPLE

Wife buys mixer grinder
Tester husband checks:

 Speed
 Noise
 Jar quality
 Warranty
 Price

He is doing full testingEXAMPLE

---
 6️⃣ How Agile Testing is Different?

 Agile Testing

 Continuous testing
 Daily testing
 Automation
 Fast feedback

 Old testing

 Testing at end
 Slow feedback
 Many bugs late

EXAMPLE

Old method:
Husband checks bank balance month end → shock 😱

Agile method:
Checks daily → safe 😎

---

 7️⃣ Traditional Testing vs Agile Testing

| Traditional       | Agile            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Testing after dev | Testing with dev |
| Big release       | Small release    |
| Late bugs         | Early bugs       |
| Separate teams    | One team         |

EXAMPLE 

Traditional marriage:
Talk after fight 😆

Agile marriage:
Talk during fight 😎

---

 8️⃣ What is Iteration 0?

 👉 Meaning

Preparation phase before sprint starts.

Things done:

 Environment setup
 Tools setup
 Test strategy
 Requirement understanding

 👉 Example

Before building app:

 Install tools
 Setup server
 Create test data

That is iteration 0.

EXAMPLE 

Before wedding:

 Venue booking
 Clothes shopping
 Invitation printing

That is Iteration 0 🤣

---

 9️⃣ User Story Perspective in Agile Testing

 👉 User Story format

“As a user, I want login feature so I can access account”

Tester checks:

 Valid login
 Invalid login
 Error message
 UI
 Performance

 👉 Real-time

Swiggy story:
“As a user, I want to order food”

Tester tests:

 Search
 Cart
 Payment
 Delivery

EXAMPLE 

Wife story:
“As a wife, I want shopping so I feel happy”

Acceptance criteria:

 Husband pays
 No complaints
 Fast billingEXAMPLE

---

 🔟 Tester Mindset Change in Agile

Old mindset:
❌ Only testing
❌ After development
❌ Finding bugs only

New Agile mindset:
✔ Work with developer
✔ Understand business
✔ Suggest improvements
✔ Automation
✔ Fast testing

Tester = Quality owner

EXAMPLE

Old husband:
“Food bad” 😡

Agile husband:
“Let’s cook together” 😍

Quality improves 😆

---

 🔵 What is Static Testing?

 👉 Simple meaning

Static testing = Testing without running application

Just check documents/code manually.

✔ Requirement document
✔ Test cases
✔ Design
✔ Code review

No execution.

---

 🟢 Real-time example

Developer writes code for login.
Before running app, tester checks code & requirement.

Find mistake early.

---

EXAMPLE

Wife writes shopping list 📝
Husband checks list before going to market.

If mistake found before shopping → Static testing 🤣

If he goes and then finds mistake → Dynamic testing 😆

---

 🔵 Types of Testing Techniques

There are 2 main types:

| Type            | Meaning             |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Static Testing  | Without running app |
| Dynamic Testing | By running app      |

---

 🟢 Example

Check question paper before exam → Static
Write exam & see mistakes → Dynamic

---

EXAMPLE 

Before cooking → checking recipe = Static
After cooking → tasting food = Dynamic 🤣

---

 🔵 Static vs Dynamic Testing

| Static Testing                 | Dynamic Testing   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| No execution                   | Execution needed  |
| Early stage                    | After build       |
| Find requirement/design issues | Find runtime bugs |
| Manual review                  | Run application   |

---

 🟢 Real-time example

Static:
Check requirement → login needs OTP

Dynamic:
Run app → OTP not coming

---

EXAMPLE

Before marriage: background checkEXAMPLE (Static)
After marriage: real behaviour 😆 (Dynamic)

---

 🔵 Static Testing Basics

 👉 When done?

Before coding & before execution.

 👉 What checked?

 Requirement document
 Design document
 Code
 Test cases

 👉 Who does?

 Tester
 Developer
 BA
 Architect

---

 🟢 Example

Requirement says:
Password must be 8 characters

Developer coded 6 characters

Tester finds in document review → static testing success.

---

EXAMPLE 

Wife message:
“Bring 1kg sugar”

Husband reads properly → brings correct
Static testing success 🤣

If he doesn’t read → brings salt 😆

---


 🔵 Benefits of Static Testing

 ✔ Find bugs early

 ✔ Saves money

 ✔ Improves quality

 ✔ Less rework

 ✔ Better understanding

---

 🟢 Real-time example

If requirement wrong → whole app wrong

Finding early saves project.

---

EXAMPLE 

If wife tells wrong train date 😆
Finding early saves travel disaster 🤣

---

🔵 What is Use Case Testing?


Use case testing = testing application based on
how real user uses system step-by-step

We test full user flow.

🟢 Real-time example: ATM withdraw

User steps:

Insert card

Enter PIN

Select withdraw

Take cash

Tester tests full flow.

📊 Line diagram
User → Insert card → Enter PIN → Withdraw → Get cash
            ↑                          ↓
          Error? ←------ System response


This full user flow = use case testing.

 Husband-wife example

Morning routine use case:

Wife wakes husband → gives tea → sends office
           ↓
      Husband late?
           ↓
        Fight 😆


Full life flow testing 🤣

🔵 Use Case Modeling
👉 Meaning

Drawing or writing how user interacts with system.

Shows:

user steps

system response

alternate paths

🟢 Swiggy example
Open app → Search food → Add to cart → Pay → Order placed


Diagram:

User
 ↓
Open App
 ↓
Search Food
 ↓
Add to Cart
 ↓
Payment
 ↓
Order Confirmed


This full flow = use case model.

🔵 Actor (Who uses system)

Actor = user of system.

Examples:

Customer

Admin

Seller

Bank user

🟢 ATM example
        [Customer]
            ↓
         ATM system
            ↓
        Withdraw cash


Actor = customer

 EXAMPLE

Home system:

Wife (Main actor)
   ↓
Husband (system) 🤣
   ↓
Money transfer


# 🟢 REAL TIME USE CASE TESTING EXAMPLE

# 🛒 E-commerce Website – “Place Order” Feature

This is 100% real company example.

---

# 🔵 Step 1: Actor (Who is user?)

Actor = Customer (who buys product)

```
Actor → Customer
System → Amazon/Flipkart website
```

---

# 🔵 Step 2: Goal of user

Customer goal:
👉 Buy product successfully

---

# 🔵 Step 3: Main Use Case Flow (Happy path)

This is normal successful scenario.

# 📊 Use Case Flow Diagram

```
Customer
   ↓
Login
   ↓
Search product
   ↓
Add to cart
   ↓
Proceed to payment
   ↓
Enter address
   ↓
Make payment
   ↓
Order placed successfully
```

This full flow = USE CASE

Tester must test full flow.

---

# 🔵 Step 4: Precondition

Before starting:

✔ User account must exist
✔ Product available
✔ Internet working
✔ Payment method available

---

# 🔵 Step 5: Postcondition

After success:

✔ Order placed
✔ Order ID generated
✔ Confirmation message
✔ Email/SMS sent

---

# 🔵 Step 6: Alternate Paths (Very important)

Alternate = different way user completes.

# Case 1: Different payment method

```
Payment page
   ↓
User selects UPI instead of card
   ↓
Payment success
   ↓
Order placed
```

# Case 2: Guest checkout

```
User not login
   ↓
Guest checkout
   ↓
Enter address
   ↓
Payment
```

Tester must test these.

---

# 🔵 Step 7: Exception Scenarios

Unexpected situation.

# Case 1: Product out of stock

```
Add to cart
   ↓
Product unavailable 😱
   ↓
Show "Out of stock"
```

# Case 2: Server down

```
Payment processing
   ↓
Server error
   ↓
Show error message
```

---

# 🔵 Step 8: Failure Scenarios (MOST IMPORTANT)

Tester must test failures.

# Case 1: Payment failed

```
Enter card details
   ↓
Wrong OTP
   ↓
Payment failed
   ↓
Order not placed
```

# Case 2: Money deducted but order not placed 😱

(Most critical bug)

```
Payment success
Money deducted
   ↓
Order not created
   ↓
BIG DEFECT 🚨
```

Tester must test this carefully.

---

# 🔵 Step 9: What Tester does in Use Case Testing?

Tester tests full end-to-end flow.

# Tester checklist:

✔ Login working?
✔ Search working?
✔ Add to cart working?
✔ Payment working?
✔ Order created?
✔ Email received?
✔ Failure handled?

---

# 🔵 Step 10: Simple Use Case Diagram

```
              Customer
                 |
                 v
              Login
                 |
                 v
           Search Product
                 |
                 v
             Add to Cart
                 |
                 v
              Payment
             /      \
       Success      Failed
          |           |
      Order placed   Retry
```

Tester must test ALL paths.
