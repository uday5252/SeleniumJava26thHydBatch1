### **Problem Statement (Explained in Simple Words)**

You are given **two strings**:

1. `full` – a complete sentence or sequence of words.
2. `partial` – a sentence that is missing some words from `full`.

Your task is to **find which words are missing in `partial` compared to `full`**, **in order**.

Think of it like checking what words someone forgot when copying a sentence.

### **Example**

```java
full = "I like to eat pizza"
partial = "I eat pizza"
```

**Step 1:** Compare the words in order:

* `I` → exists in partial → skip
* `like` → missing → add to result
* `to` → missing → add to result
* `eat` → exists → skip
* `pizza` → exists → skip

**Output:**

```java
["like", "to"]
```
