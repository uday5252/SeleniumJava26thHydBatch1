 Movie Ticket Booking

 📌 Problem Description (Clear & Simple)

You are designing a movie theatre booking system.

The system must protect seat information so that:

 Seat counts cannot be changed directly
 Seats can be booked only by following defined rules

This question tests your understanding of encapsulation in Java.

 🧱 Class to Design

 Class Name:

`MovieTheatre`

---

 🔒 Private Data Members

| Variable         | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `totalSeats`     | Total number of seats in the theatre (fixed after creation) |
| `availableSeats` | Number of seats currently available                         |

 Important Rules:

 Both variables must be private
 No setters should be provided
 External classes must not be able to modify these values directly

---

 🛠 Public Methods

 1️⃣ `bookSeats(int count)`

This method is used to book seats.

# Booking Rules:

 `count` must be greater than 0
 `count` must be less than or equal to available seats
 If booking is valid:

   Seats are booked
   Available seat count is reduced
 If booking is invalid:

   Booking must be rejected with a proper message

---

 2️⃣ `getAvailableSeats()`

 Returns the current number of available seats
 Must not allow modification of seat data

---

 🚫 Restrictions (Very Important)

 Seat count must not be modified directly
 No method should allow resetting or overwriting seat values
 All seat changes must go through `bookSeats()`

---

 🧪 Test Cases (Expected Behavior)

 ✅ Test Case 1: Valid Booking

Action: Book 10 seats when 100 are available
Expected Result:

 Booking succeeds
 Available seats become 90

---

 ❌ Test Case 2: Booking More Than Available

Action: Book 50 seats when only 30 are available
Expected Result:

 Booking fails
 Available seats remain 30

---

 ❌ Test Case 3: Booking Zero Seats

Action: Book 0 seats
Expected Result:

 Booking rejected

---

 ❌ Test Case 4: Booking Negative Seats

Action: Book -5 seats
Expected Result:

 Booking rejected

---

 ❌ Test Case 5: Direct Seat Modification Attempt

Action: Try to directly change `availableSeats`
Expected Result:

 Compilation error (variable is private)

---

 ✅ Test Case 6: Multiple Valid Bookings

Action:

 Book 20 seats
 Book 30 seats

Expected Result:

 Both bookings succeed if seats are available
 Available seats reduce correctly

========================


```java
class MovieTheatre {

    // 🔒 Private data members
    private int totalSeats;
    private int availableSeats;

    // 🧱 Simple constructor (NO logic)
    public MovieTheatre(int seats) {
        totalSeats = seats;
        availableSeats = seats;
    }

    // 🛠 Book seats method (ALL logic here)
    public void bookSeats(int count) {

        if (count <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Booking rejected: Seat count must be greater than 0");
            return;
        }

        if (count > availableSeats) {
            System.out.println("Booking rejected: Not enough seats available");
            return;
        }

        availableSeats = availableSeats - count;
        System.out.println("Booking successful: " + count + " seats booked");
    }

    // 📤 Read-only access
    public int getAvailableSeats() {
        return availableSeats;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Test Class

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        MovieTheatre theatre = new MovieTheatre(100);

        // ✅ Valid booking
        theatre.bookSeats(10);
        System.out.println("Available Seats: " + theatre.getAvailableSeats());

        // ❌ Zero seats
        theatre.bookSeats(0);

        // ❌ Negative seats
        theatre.bookSeats(-5);

        // ✅ Multiple bookings
        theatre.bookSeats(20);
        theatre.bookSeats(30);
        System.out.println("Available Seats: " + theatre.getAvailableSeats());

        // ❌ More than available
        theatre.bookSeats(50);

        // ❌ Direct modification (Compilation Error)
        // theatre.availableSeats = 200;
    }
}
```
