 🟦 1. Introduction to SCRUM

 What is Scrum?

Scrum means doing work in small small parts, not full work at once.

You work in short cycles called sprints (2 weeks usually).
After each sprint → show work → take feedback → improve.

---

 🏠 Husband–Wife Example (Best one)

Husband decides:

> I will secretly build full dream house and surprise my wife after 1 year.

After 1 year…

Wife sees:

 Kitchen wrong direction
 Bedroom small
 No dressing room

She says:

> Who asked you to build like this? 😑

All work wasted.

---

 Smart husband uses Scrum

Week 1:
Build bedroom → show wife
Wife: “Make wardrobe bigger”

Week 2:
Fix wardrobe + build kitchen
Wife: “Add modular kitchen”

Week 3:
Build hall

Finally house perfect.

👉 This is Scrum
Build small → take feedback → improve.

---

 🏢 Real IT Example

Swiggy doesn’t build full app for 1 year.

They release:

 Coupons feature
 Then ratings
 Then voice search
 Then UI changes

Small updates → feedback → improvement.

---

 🟦 2. Scrum Roles

Scrum has 3 roles:

 Product Owner
 Scrum Master
 Team

Let’s understand with husband–wife life.

---

 🟨 Product Owner (PO)

 Who is PO?

Person who decides:

 What to build
 What first
 What later

---

 👩 Wife Example

In most homes:
Wife decides:

 Which sofa
 Which color
 Which TV
 Which curtains

Husband only pays and works 😄

So wife = Product Owner.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Product Owner says:

> Add payment feature first
> Add dark mode later

Team follows.

---

 🟨 Scrum Master

 Who is Scrum Master?

Problem solver for team.

Removes obstacles.

---

 👩‍🦰 Example

Husband working from home.

Problems:

 Internet not working
 Power cut
 Noise outside

Wife:

 Calls electrician
 Fixes WiFi
 Manages disturbance

Husband continues work peacefully.

Wife = Scrum Master here.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Developer stuck:
Server down.

Scrum master:

 Calls infra team
 Fixes server
 Work continues

---

 🟨 Development Team

Team builds product.

---

 🍳 Example

At home dinner:
Wife cooking
Husband cutting vegetables
Child setting table

Food ready.

Everyone contributed.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Team:

 Developers code
 Testers test
 Designer designs

Feature delivered.

---

 🟦 3. User Story

 What is user story?

Requirement from user side.

Format:

> As a user I want ___ so that ___

---

 👩 Wife Example

Wife says:

> As a wife I want bigger wardrobe
> so that I can keep my dresses

Clear requirement.

---

 🏢 IT Example

> As a user I want login
> so that I can access account

---

 🟦 4. Sprint

 What is Sprint?

Fixed time to complete work (2 weeks).

---

 🧹 Example

Wife says:

> Within 2 days clean full house.

Husband plans:

 Day 1 → Hall + kitchen
 Day 2 → Bedroom

Completes in 2 days.

That 2-day cycle = Sprint.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Sprint 1:
Login

Sprint 2:
Cart

Sprint 3:
Payment

---

 🟦 5. Scrum Meetings

 🟨 Sprint Planning

Decide what to do in sprint.

 🛒 Example

Wife:

> Guests coming Sunday
> Clean house + buy groceries

Plan created.

---

 🟨 Daily Standup

Daily update.

 Example

Morning discussion:

Husband:

> Yesterday cleaned hall
> Today kitchen
> Problem: broom missing

Wife resolves.

---

 🟨 Sprint Review

Show work at end.

 Example

House cleaned.

Wife inspects:

> Good… but balcony not cleaned.

Feedback given.

---

 🟨 Retrospective

Discuss improvement.

 Example

After guests leave:

> Next time start cleaning earlier
> Don’t postpone work

---

 🟦 6. Story Points

Measure difficulty.

---

 🍲 Example

Cooking difficulty:

Tea → easy
Lunch → medium
Wedding cooking → very difficult

Same story points.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Login → 3
Cart → 5
Payment → 13

---

 🟦 7. Planning Poker

Team estimates work.

---

 💰 Example

Wife asks:

> How much will sofa cost?

Husband: 20k
Wife: 30k
Shopkeeper: 40k

Discussion → final 30k.

Same planning poker.

---

 🟦 8. Velocity

Team speed.

---

 🧹 Example

Husband cleans:
2 rooms per day.

So speed known.

Next time planning easy.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Team completes:
25 story points per sprint.

Next sprint planned accordingly.

---

 🟦 9. Definition of Done (DoD)

When work fully complete.

---

 🍽 Example

Wife says:
Dish washed only when:

 Soap used
 Rinsed
 Kept in place

Not just water touch.

---

 🏢 IT Example

Feature done only when:

 Code complete
 Tested
 No bugs
 Approved

---

Perfect 👍
Now I’ll explain technically + husband-wife example together
so you understand concept + real IT usage clearly.

This is exactly how interviewers expect answer.

---

 🟥 PROBLEMS WITH SCRUM (Technical + Simple example)

Scrum is good for planned development
but not good for unplanned or urgent work

---

 🔴 Problem 1: Sprint cannot change (technical)

 📘 Technical explanation

In Scrum:

 Sprint duration fixed (2 weeks)
 Sprint backlog locked
 New tasks cannot be added

Reason:
Team focus should not change during sprint.

But real IT world:

 Production bugs come
 Client urgent change
 Server down

You cannot wait till next sprint.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Husband-wife example

Wife gives list:

 Buy vegetables
 Clean house
 Pay bill

Husband plans full day.

Suddenly guests coming.

Wife:

> Go bring sweets also

Husband:

> Already planned tasks 😑

But real life:
He must go immediately.

Scrum fails here.

---

 🏢 Real IT example

Sprint started Monday.

Wednesday:
Production payment failure.

Client losing money.

Can team say:

> We will fix next sprint?

No.

So Scrum rigid structure becomes problem.

---

 🔴 Problem 2: Too many meetings

 📘 Technical explanation

Scrum has many ceremonies:

 Sprint planning
 Daily standup
 Sprint review
 Retrospective

If team small → fine
If project heavy → time-consuming

Sometimes more meeting, less work.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Husband working from home.

Wife calls every hour:

 What doing?
 What completed?
 What next?

Husband:

> Let me work also 😭

Same feeling developers get.

---

 🏢 Real IT example

Team spends:

 2 hrs planning
 30 min daily standup
 2 hrs review
 1 hr retrospective

Less coding time.

---

 🔴 Problem 3: Sprint commitment pressure

 📘 Technical explanation

Team commits story points at sprint start.

Example:
Commit = 40 points
Completed = 25

Management questions:

> Why not completed?

Even if complexity high.

Creates stress.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Wife gives husband 10 tasks:

 Clean house
 Buy groceries
 Fix bulb
 Wash car

He finishes 7.

Wife:

> Why not all 10?

Husband stressed 😐

---

 🏢 Real IT example

Unexpected issues:

 Server down
 Requirement change
 Complex bug

Still team judged by commitment.

---

 🔴 Problem 4: Not good for support/DevOps teams

 📘 Technical explanation

Scrum best for:
👉 New feature development

Not good for:
👉 Production support
👉 DevOps
👉 Maintenance team

Because work comes anytime.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Daily home work:

 Doorbell anytime
 Delivery anytime
 Phone calls anytime

Cannot plan everything in morning only.

---

 🏢 Real IT example

Support team day:
10 AM → bug
12 PM → server issue
3 PM → client call
5 PM → DB error

Cannot wait for next sprint.

---

 🟩 So companies introduced KANBAN

 🟩 What is Kanban? (technical)

Kanban = Continuous workflow system.

No sprint.
No fixed commitment.
Work taken as it comes.

Board:

```
To Do → In Progress → Done
```

Work flows continuously.

---

 📘 Technical features of Kanban

1. No sprint
2. Continuous delivery
3. Work in progress (WIP) limit
4. Visual board tracking
5. Flexible priorities

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Daily home tasks board:

To do:

 Buy milk
 Wash clothes

In progress:

 Cooking

Done:

 Cleaning

Pick task anytime.
Finish anytime.

No 2-week planning.

---

 🏢 Real IT example

Production support team:
Bug comes → fix
Next bug → fix
Urgent issue → handle

No sprint wait.

---

 🟥 EXTREME PROGRAMMING (XP)

 📘 Technical meaning

XP focuses on:
👉 High-quality coding
👉 Continuous testing
👉 Frequent releases
👉 Developer collaboration

Used in critical systems.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Guests coming home.

Wife cooking carefully:

 Tastes salt
 Checks spice
 Rechecks

Because guests important.

Same XP ensures perfect code.

---

 XP PRACTICES (Technical + Example)

 🟦 1. Pair Programming

 Technical

Two developers work on one system.

 One writes code
 One reviews

Reduces bugs.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Husband cooking.
Wife watching:

> Add salt carefully.

Mistakes avoided.

---

 🏢 IT example

Banking payment module.
Two developers code together to avoid errors.

---

 🟦 2. Test Driven Development (TDD)

 Technical

Write test case first.
Then write code.

Ensures correct logic.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Wife reads recipe fully
then starts cooking.

Not random cooking.

---

 🏢 IT example

Before login code:
Write test:

> Login should work with valid credentials

Then write code.

---

 🟦 3. Continuous Integration

 Technical

Developers push code daily.
Automated testing runs.

Bugs detected early.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Taste food while cooking.
Not after burning.

---

 🏢 IT example

Developer pushes code → Jenkins runs tests → errors found immediately.

---

 🟦 4. Small releases

 Technical

Release small features frequently.

Instead of 6-month big release.

---

 👩‍❤️‍👨 Example

Instead of cooking 10 dishes at once,
serve hot chapati one by one.

Better quality.

---

 🟪 FINAL TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE

| Method | Best for            | Why               |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Scrum  | Feature development | Planned work      |
| Kanban | Support/maintenance | Continuous work   |
| XP     | Critical systems    | High quality code |

---

 🎯 Interview Question (must know)

 Q: Why Kanban when Scrum exists?

Technical Answer:
Scrum is suitable for planned sprint-based development.
However, it is not flexible for continuous and urgent work like production support.
Kanban provides continuous workflow, flexible priorities, and no sprint restriction, making it suitable for support and DevOps teams.
