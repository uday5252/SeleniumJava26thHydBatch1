 🎼 Music Band 

 What is given?

Imagine:

 There are many singers
 Each singer sings at a certain pitch level
 All pitch levels are written in an array

Example:

```text
pitches = [10, 12, 13, 9, 14]
```

---

 What does the organizer want?

The music band organizer wants to form a band with the maximum number of singers, but with one harmony rule.

---

 The rule

1. Take the selected singers’ pitch levels
2. Sort them
3. The difference between two neighboring pitches must be:

    ✅ `0` → same pitch (perfect harmony)
    ✅ `1` → slightly higher pitch (still sounds good)
    ❌ `2 or more` → sounds bad, not allowed

---

 Meaning in simple words

👉 The band can only include:

 Singers with exactly the same pitch, OR
 Singers whose pitches differ by only 1

You cannot mix singers with large pitch gaps.

---

 Understanding with example

 Given pitches:

```text
[10, 12, 13, 9, 14]
```

---

 🎶 Valid band 1

```text
{9, 10}
```

Sorted → `[9, 10]`
Difference → `1` ✅
Band size → `2`

---

 🎶 Valid band 2

```text
{12, 13, 14}
```

Sorted → `[12, 13, 14]`
Differences:

 `13 - 12 = 1` ✅
 `14 - 13 = 1` ✅

Band size → `3`

---

 🚫 Invalid band

```text
{10, 12}
```

Sorted → `[10, 12]`
Difference → `2` ❌
The band sounds bad → not allowed

---

 Final goal (same as original problem)

From all possible harmonious bands:

> Find the band with the maximum number of singers

Here:

 Band `{9, 10}` → size `2`
 Band `{12, 13, 14}` → size `3`

👉 Maximum size = 3

---

 🧠 One-line takeaway

> Pick the largest group where everyone is on the same pitch or just one pitch apart.
