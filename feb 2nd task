MOVIE BOOKING APPLICATION

 📌 Problem Statement

Design a Movie Booking Application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

The application should allow users to:

1. Book movie tickets
2. Calculate total ticket price based on movie type
3. Validate seat booking
4. Support multiple movie categories with different pricing logic


 🧱 Functional Requirements

 1️⃣ Movie Details

Each movie should have:

 Movie name
 Base ticket price

---

 2️⃣ Movie Types

The system should support at least:

 Regular Movie
 Premium Movie

Each movie type should calculate ticket price differently.

---

 3️⃣ Ticket Price Calculation Rules

 Regular Movie:
  `Total Price = Base Price × Number of Seats`

 Premium Movie:
  `Total Price = (Base Price × Number of Seats) + 20% extra charge`

---

 4️⃣ Seat Validation

 Number of seats must be greater than 0
 Invalid bookings should be rejected

---

 5️⃣ Booking

 A booking should be associated with one movie
 Total price should be calculated using the movie’s pricing logic

---
