  1. Test Organization

This simply means how the testing team is arranged inside a company.

---

Think of Test Organization as a family tree of the QA team — who is the parent, who is the child, who helps whom.

---

  Analogy (Super Simple)

Imagine a hospital.

* Doctor = Developer
* Nurse = Tester
* Head Nurse = Test Lead
* Hospital Manager = QA Manager

Doctors treat patients (code).
Nurses check patients again and again (testing).
Head Nurse assigns duties (Test Lead).
Hospital Manager runs everything (QA Manager).

Same vibe for software testing.

---

  Technical View (Real Industry)

 The QA team usually looks like this:

1. QA Manager

   * Makes company-wide testing strategy(discussed in later section)
   * Decides automation, tools, processes

2. Test Lead / Test Manager

   * Assigns work to testers

3. Test Engineers (Manual Testers)

   * Write and run manual test cases
   * Identify bugs
   * Verify fixes

4. Automation Engineers

   * Write automation scripts using
     Selenium, Playwright, Cypress


---

  2. Independent Testing

 
Independent testing means testing done by someone who did NOT write the code(Ex: Tester).

Because the person who creates something usually misses their own mistakes.

---

 ⚡ Analogy

If you cook a dish yourself and taste it…
You think: “Yum! Perfect!”
But your friend eats it and says: “Bro… too much salt.”

That's independent judgement.

Same for software — testers find bugs that developers miss.

---

 
  3. Tasks of Test Manager and Tester

---

 🧑‍💼 A. Test Manager (Boss of Testing)

 💡 Easy English

Test Manager decides what to test, how to test, and who will test.

---

 🎭 Analogy

Think of a movie director:

* Chooses actors
* Allocates budgets
* Plans scenes
* Manages shooting schedule
* Removes risks

Test Manager does the same but for testing.

---

---

 👨‍🔧 B. Tester (The real hero)

 💡 Easy English

Tester’s job: Try to break the software in a smart way.

---

 🎭 Analogy

Tester is like a police officer checking a car:

* Check headlights
* Check brakes
* Check license
* Check engine
* Try to find what’s wrong

They must find issues before the car goes on road.

---

 🧠 Technical Responsibilities

2. Write test cases & test scenarios
3. Create test data
4. Execute tests (manual or automation)
5. Report bugs 
6. Retesting fixes



Test Estimation Techniques 

Test Estimation means:

> Calculating how much time, effort, and people you need to complete testing.

Think of it as:

> Planning a journey — you estimate how much time, fuel, money, and people you need.

---

  1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

 ✔ Easy English

Break the whole testing task into small, small pieces, then estimate each piece.

 ✔ Analogy

Imagine building a house:
You divide the work into:

* Foundation
* Walls
* Paint
* Electric work

Then estimate each item.

 ✔ Technical Example

Testing an e-commerce site:

Break tasks:

* Understanding Requirements – 1 day
* Writing test cases – 3 days
* Executing test cases – 5 days
* Regression testing – 2 days
* Reporting – 1 day

Total = 12 days.

---

  2. Three-Point Estimation (PERT)

 ✔ Easy English

Instead of giving one estimate, you give three:

* Optimistic time (O) → If everything goes smoothly
* Pessimistic time (P) → If everything goes wrong
* Most likely (M) → Practical estimate

Formula:

```
Estimate = (O + M + P) / 3
```

 ✔ Analogy

If you travel to office:

* Best-case = 20 min (no traffic)
* Average = 30 min
* Worst = 50 min (big traffic)

Estimated time = (20 + 30 + 50) / 3 = 33 minutes

 ✔ Technical Example

Writing test cases:

* O = 3 days
* M = 4 days
* P = 6 days

Estimate = (3+4+6) / 3 = 4.33 days

---

  3. Function Point Estimation (FPA)

 ✔ Easy English

You calculate the size of the application based on features.
More features = more testing = more time.

 ✔ Analogy

Like measuring house size in square feet to calculate painting cost.

 ✔ Technical Explanation

Function Points include:

* Inputs
* Outputs
* User interactions
* Files
* External interfaces

Each function gets points based on complexity (simple/medium/high).

Then:

```
Total FP × Testing Effort per FP = Total Testing Time
```

Example:
A signup form = 4 FPs
A payment gateway = 12 FPs
A product catalog = 8 FPs

Total = 24 FP
If 1 FP = 2 hours,
Testing = 48 hours.

---

  4. Test Case Point Estimation

 ✔ Easy English

Count how many test cases you need → calculate how long each test case takes.

 ✔ Analogy

Like counting how many questions are in your exam → estimating how long the exam takes.

 ✔ Technical Example

* You have 240 test cases
* One tester can execute 10 test cases per hour

So:

```
Total hours = 240 / 10 = 24 hours
```

If you have 2 testers:

```
24 / 2 = 12 hours
```

---

  5. Expert Judgment Technique

 ✔ Easy English

Ask senior testers / leads who have experience with similar projects.

 ✔ Analogy

If you don’t know how long cooking biryani takes, you ask your mom.

 ✔ Technical Example

Senior tester says:

> “Module A is medium complexity → needs 3 days.”
> “Module B is heavy → needs 7 days.”

This is based on real past experience.

---

  6. Delphi Technique

 ✔ Easy English

You ask multiple experts separately.
They send estimates anonymously.
Then you average them.

 ✔ Analogy

Like asking 5 friends to guess the price of a car without telling each other, then taking the average.

 ✔ Technical Example

Three testers give estimates for test case writing:

* Tester 1 → 4 days
* Tester 2 → 5 days
* Tester 3 → 6 days

Average = (4+5+6) / 3 = 5 days.

---

  7. Percentage Effort Estimation Technique

 ✔ Easy English

Testing is calculated as a percentage of development effort.

 ✔ Analogy

If you build a house, interior design is usually 20–30% of construction work.

 ✔ Technical Explanation

If development = 100 days
Testing = usually 30%–50%

So testing = 30 to 50 days.

---

  8. Use Case Point Estimation

 ✔ Easy English

Estimate testing based on the number of use cases and their complexity.

 ✔ Analogy

If you have more scenes in a movie, you need more time to shoot.

 ✔ Technical Example

Use Cases:

* Login → Simple → 5 points
* Search product → Medium → 10 points
* Payment → Complex → 20 points

Total = 35 points
If each point = 1 hour → 35 hours of testing.



  What is Test Planning?

Test planning means deciding everything before starting testing:

* what to test
* how to test
* who will test
* when to test
* what tools to use
* what risks may come

A plan that makes testing smooth and organized.

---

  Analogy (Very Easy)

Imagine you want to cook a big dinner for 10 people.

Before cooking, you plan:

* What dishes to make (scope)
* Ingredients needed (test data)
* Who will cut vegetables, who will cook (roles)
* Time to finish each dish (schedule)
* What can go wrong? Gas might get over (risks)

This “prior planning” = Test Planning.

---

  Technical Meaning

Test planning is a strategic activity done by the Test Manager or Test Lead.

It defines:

✔ Test objectives
✔ Testing scope
✔ Approach (manual, automation, performance)
✔ Resources (testers, tools)
✔ Test environment
✔ Risk management
✔ Schedules & milestones
✔ Test deliverables

---
