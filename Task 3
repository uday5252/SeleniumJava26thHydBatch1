 Question 1:

A transport management system handles different types of vehicles such as Car and Bike.
Both vehicles share common properties like `vehicleNumber` and `fuelType`, and a common method `displayDetails()`.

Design the system using only inheritance so that common data and behavior are reused.

Test Case:
Input:
Car → vehicleNumber = "KA01AB1234", fuelType = "Petrol"
Bike → vehicleNumber = "KA02XY5678", fuelType = "Electric"

Output:
Vehicle Number: KA01AB1234, Fuel Type: Petrol
Vehicle Number: KA02XY5678, Fuel Type: Electric

 Question 2

A university payroll system manages TeachingStaff and NonTeachingStaff.
All staff members have `name` and `id`, but salary calculation differs for each type.

Design this system using an abstract class where salary calculation is declared but implemented by subclasses.

Test Case:
Input:
TeachingStaff → name = "Anita", id = 101, basicPay = 40000
NonTeachingStaff → name = "Ravi", id = 102, dailyWage = 800, daysWorked = 25

Output:
Anita Salary: 50000
Ravi Salary: 20000

 Question 3

A drawing application supports shapes that must calculate both area and perimeter.
The shapes supported are Circle and Rectangle.

Design this system using an interface that enforces area and perimeter calculation.

Test Case:
Input:
Circle → radius = 7
Rectangle → length = 10, width = 5

Output:
Circle Area: 154
Circle Perimeter: 44
Rectangle Area: 50
Rectangle Perimeter: 30
