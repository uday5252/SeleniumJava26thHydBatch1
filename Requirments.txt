
  REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING

 🛫 Mega Analogy: Building an Airport

Building an airport is large, complex, and involves many people — just like building software.

If requirements are wrong:

* Flights crash
* People get delayed
* Safety issues occur
* Millions are wasted

This is exactly what happens in software too.

---

 1️⃣ EVOLUTION OF REQUIREMENTS

Requirements always change — before, during, and after development.

 🛫 Airport Analogy:

At first, the government says:

* “We need an airport with 1 runway.”

Later:

* “Add one more runway for international flights.”

Later:

* “Add cargo terminal also.”

After the airport opens:

* “Add self-check-in KIOSKS.”
* “Add facial recognition gates.”

Requirements evolve because:

* New technology appears
* New customer needs
* New laws (immigration, security rules)
* More passengers than expected

 🍔 Real Software Example: Zomato/Swiggy

Initially:

* App only allowed ordering food.

Later requirements evolved:

* Add live order tracking
* Add pay using UPI/Wallet
* Add restaurant rating
* Add delivery person chat
* Add grocery delivery (Instamart/Zomato Market)

Requirements evolve continuously.

 2️⃣ WHO PROVIDES REQUIREMENTS?

Many people provide requirements — not just users.

 🛫 Airport Analogy:

| Person                    | What Requirement They Give                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Passengers                | Comfortable waiting areas, enough washrooms |
| Pilots                    | Long runways, proper markings               |
| ATC (Air Traffic Control) | Radar systems, communication systems        |
| Security                  | Scanners, metal detectors, CCTV             |
| Government                | Safety rules, immigration process           |
| Vendors                   | Food courts, shops                          |

 🍔 Software Example: Zomato/Swiggy

| Stakeholder       | Requirements                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Users             | Easy ordering, fast delivery            |
| Delivery partners | Accurate maps, optimized routes         |
| Restaurant owners | Simple menu upload, order notifications |
| Finance team      | GST, invoices                           |
| Legal team        | FSSAI rules, privacy laws               |
| Developers        | Clear API designs                       |
| Marketing         | Offers, coupons, banners                |

Software requirements come from everyone affected by the product.

---

 3️⃣ CHALLENGES IN REQUIREMENT GATHERING

Requirement gathering is hard because:

---

 🛑 1. People Are Not Clear About What They Want

Passengers say, “Make airport comfortable.”
But what is comfortable? AC? Sofas? Restaurants?

Same in software:
Users say, “Make app fast.”
But how fast?

---

 🛑 2. Conflicting Requirements

Security team: “Strict checking.”
Passengers: “Fast entry.”
These two conflict.

Software example:

* Users want password-less login
* Security team wants strong passwords

---

 🛑 3. Hidden Requirements

Passenger assumes:

* “Of course there will be Wi-Fi.”
  But they never mentioned it.

Software users assume:

* “Of course app will work on slow internet.”

Hidden needs create problems later.

---

 🛑 4. Continuous Change

Government suddenly changes immigration policy → airport must adjust.

In software:
UPI becomes popular → app must add UPI payment.

---

 🛑 5. Technical Limitations

Stakeholders ask for something impossible.

Airport:
“Can you make 10 flights take off at same time?”
No — runway limit.

Software:
“We want infinite scalability with zero budget.”
Not possible.

---

 4️⃣ WHY WE NEED GOOD REQUIREMENTS?

 ✈️ Airport Example:

If requirements are bad:

* Runway too short → Flights cannot land safely
* No enough parking slots → Flight delays
* Immigration area too small → Long queues
* Wrong gate numbering → Confusion

Millions of rupees and human lives at risk.

 🍔 Software Example (Zomato/Swiggy):

If requirements are wrong:

* Wrong delivery address → food never arrives
* Payment failures → customers lose money
* Wrong order tracking → people get angry
* Missing GST invoice → legal issues
* Too slow app → users uninstall

Good requirements ensure:

* Safety
* Speed
* User satisfaction
* Legal compliance
* Low cost

---

 5️⃣ BAD REQUIREMENTS — CHARACTERISTICS & IMPACT

 ❌ What are bad requirements?

1. Incomplete
   “Add login feature.” But no details about password rules.

2. Ambiguous
   “Make app fast.” (How fast?)

3. Contradicting
   One says store full user data.
   Another says do not store anything (privacy).

4. Not testable
   “App should be beautiful.” → How to test?

5. Too technical
   “Use MySQL only” even when MongoDB is better.

---

 ❌ Impact of Bad Requirements (Airport)

* Runway built wrongly → entire airport must be rebuilt
* Luggage belts too short → jams
* Not enough chairs → passenger complaints
* Wrong wiring → fire hazard

Cost = Crores lost

---

 ❌ Impact of Bad Requirements (Zomato)

* Wrong delivery charges → company loses money
* Incorrect tax logic → penalties
* Users uninstall due to slow app
* Delivery persons get wrong location → delays

---

 6️⃣ REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING PROCESS (Deep + Simple)

Requirement Engineering has 5 main steps:

---

 1️⃣ Elicitation (Collecting Requirements)

 🛫 Airport Example:

* Interviews with pilots
* Talking to passengers
* Observing peak time traffic
* Discussing with security officers
* Studying government rules

 🍔 Zomato Example:

* Talking to restaurant owners
* Understanding user pain (late delivery, missing items)
* Observing order patterns
* Asking delivery partners

Tools used:

* Interviews
* Surveys
* Workshops
* Brainstorming
* Prototyping

---

 2️⃣ Analysis (Sorting and Understanding Requirements)

We identify:

* Conflicts
* Missing information
* Feasibility
* Prioritization

 🛫 Airport:

Security wants strict checking → long queues
Passengers want fast entry → short queues
We find balance:
Fast-track lanes + strong scanning machines

 🍔 Zomato:

Marketing wants ads
Users hate too many ads
Solution:
Show limited ads + offer premium ad-free subscription

---

 3️⃣ Specification (Writing Requirements Clearly)

We write:

* Functional requirements
* Non-functional requirements
* Business rules
* Constraints

 🛫 Airport:

Instead of writing “big runway”, we write:

* Runway length = 3,800 meters
* Width = 60 meters
* Material: reinforced concrete

 🍔 Zomato:

Instead of “fast delivery”, we write:

* “90% of orders must be delivered within 35 minutes.”

This makes it testable.

---



5️⃣ Requirements Management (Handling changes)

After project starts, changes WILL come.

 🛫 Airport:

Passenger traffic increases → add new terminal
New planes introduced → modify runway strength

 🍔 Zomato:

New payment method → update system
New tax rules → update billing app

Requirements management:

* Change requests
* Impact analysis
* Version control
* Traceability

---
  FUNCTIONAL vs NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

---

 1️⃣ Functional Requirements (FR) — WHAT the system must do

Functional = functions / actions / behaviors.

 🛫 Airport Analogy:

Functional Requirements answer: What should the airport do?

Examples:

* Airport must allow passengers to check-in.
* Airport must scan luggage.
* Airport must issue boarding passes.
* Airport must guide planes for landing.
* Airport must stamp passports.

These are actions the airport performs.

 🍔 Zomato Real-Time Example:

Functional Requirements:

* User must be able to search restaurants.
* User must place an order.
* Delivery partner must accept or reject an order.
* Restaurants must receive notifications.
* Payment must be processed.

These are visible features.

---

 2️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) — HOW the system must behave

NFRs describe quality, not features.

 🛫 Airport Analogy:

Non-functional requirements:

* Passenger security check should take < 10 minutes.
* Runway must handle aircraft of 500 tons.
* Airport must work 24/7 with 99.99% uptime.
* Noise levels must be controlled.
* CCTV videos must be stored for 90 days.
* Immigration processing must follow government rules.

These do not add new features, but define quality.

 🍔 Zomato Example:

NFRs:

* App must load home page in < 2 seconds.
* System should handle 50,000 users during peak time.
* Payment system must have 99.9% success rate.
* App should work on 3G networks.
* User data must be encrypted.

These make the app better, not bigger.

---

 🧲 Simple Comparison (Airport Example)

| Type           | Airport Example              | Meaning             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Functional     | Check-in, boarding, scanning | What airport does   |
| Non-functional | Speed, safety, capacity      | How well it does it |

---

 3️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements: FURPS+ Model

FURPS+ is a famous model to classify NFRs.

Let’s explain with Airport + Zomato examples:

---

 F — Functionality

Even though “Functionality” is in FURPS, it refers to quality of functional features.

🛫 Airport:

* Passport scanner must read all modern chip passports.

🍔 Zomato:

* Payment system must support UPI, card, wallet.

---

 U — Usability

How easy it is for users.

🛫 Airport:

* Clear signs, simple navigation, easy-to-find gates.

🍔 Zomato:

* Simple UI, easy cart, easy tracking.

---

 R — Reliability

How dependable the system is.

🛫 Airport:

* Backup power must activate within 10 seconds.
* Radar must be available 99.99% of the time.

🍔 Zomato:

* App must not crash.
* Delivery tracking must be accurate.

---

 P — Performance

Speed, capacity, response time.

🛫 Airport:

* Immigration queue time < 15 minutes.
* Runway can handle 30 flights per hour.

🍔 Zomato:

* App loads in 2 sec.
* Server handles 50k requests/min.

---

 S — Supportability

How easy it is to update, maintain, or extend.

🛫 Airport:

* Modular terminal design for future expansion.

🍔 Zomato:

* Easy integration of new restaurants.
* Upgradable payment gateway.

---

 “+” — Extras

Security, legal, scalability, availability, compatibility, etc.

🛫 Airport:

* Follow international aviation laws.
* CCTV + biometric entry.

🍔 Zomato:

* GDPR data privacy.
* Fraud detection.
* Multi-device compatibility.

---

 4️⃣ Stable vs Volatile Requirements

---

 🔹 Stable Requirements

These don't change often.

 🛫 Airport:

* Need for security scanning.
* Need for runways.
* Need for baggage handling.

They will be needed always.

 🍔 Zomato:

* Users will always need ordering.
* Restaurants will always need order acceptance.
* Payments will always be required.

Stable ≈ core requirements.

---

 🔹 Volatile Requirements

These change based on trends, market, or technology.

 🛫 Airport:

* Need for COVID screening came suddenly.
* Facial recognition gates added recently.
* New immigration policies anytime.

 🍔 Zomato:

* UPI payment → added later.
* Grocery delivery → became popular after COVID.
* Dark stores (instamart) introduced later.

Volatile = changing requirements.

---

 5️⃣ Baselining Requirements

Baselining = Freezing requirements at a point in time
→ After this, any change must go through approval.

 🛫 Airport:

Finalized airport blueprint = Baseline.
After this, if someone says:
“Add 3 more restaurants,”
→ It needs approval, cost analysis, time analysis.

 🍔 Zomato:

Once requirements for "Order Tracking Module" are frozen:

* API designs
* UI screens
* Database tables

Any change after baseline requires:

* Change Request (CR)
* Approval
* Cost analysis

Baseline helps avoid chaos.

---

 6️⃣ Requirements Traceability

Traceability = Tracking requirements from start to end.

 🛫 Airport:

Requirement: "Install CCTV"
Trace:

* Design shows CCTV locations
* Contractor installs heat-proof CCTV
* Testing team checks angle and clarity
* Compliance signs approval form

Everything is traceable.

 🍔 Zomato Example:

Requirement: “Add live order tracking.”

Trace:

* Product doc
* API design
* Backend code
* Mobile UI
* Test cases
* Release notes

If one piece is missing → we immediately know.

---

 7️⃣ Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

RTM = Table that connects:

* Requirements
* Design
* Test cases
* Status

Helps ensure *no requirement is missed*.

---

 🛫 Airport RTM Example:

| Requirement          | Design | Install | Testing | Status  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| R1: Runway 3800m     | D1     | I1      | T1      | Done    |
| R2: CCTV in terminal | D2     | I2      | T2      | Pending |
| R3: Fire alarms      | D3     | I3      | T3      | Done    |

---

 🍔 Zomato RTM Example:

| Requirement      | Design Doc | Code Module | Test Case | Status |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| R1 Order food    | FSD-101    | API-Order   | TC-01     | Passed |
| R2 UPI payment   | FSD-102    | API-Payment | TC-45     | Passed |
| R3 Live tracking | FSD-103    | API-Track   | TC-60     | Failed |
| R4 Rating system | FSD-104    | API-Rating  | TC-70     | Passed |

RTM ensures:
✔ Nothing is missed
✔ Everything is tested
✔ Changes are tracked
✔ Full project visibility

---



 ✅ Requirements Traceability

 What is Requirement Traceability?

👉 It means tracking every requirement from start to end so nothing gets lost.

 Simple Analogy

Imagine your mom gives you a shopping list:

* Buy milk
* Buy bread
* Buy vegetables

When you go to the market, you tick each item to make sure you bought everything.
This is traceability → tracking what was asked vs what is done.

 Real-Time Example

You are building a food delivery app.
Requirement: “User should track the delivery on map.”

Traceability ensures:

* You design the map screen
* You code the map feature
* You test it
* You verify with customer

Everything aligns with the original requirement.

---

 ✅ Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

 What is RTM?

A table that connects:
✔ Requirements
✔ Design
✔ Development
✔ Test cases
✔ Defects (if any)

It ensures each requirement is covered, implemented, and tested.

 Analogy

School exam timetable:

* Chapter 1 → Question 1
* Chapter 2 → Question 5

Each chapter is mapped to a question → nothing is skipped.
Similarly, RTM maps requirements to test cases.

 Real-Time Example RTM

| Requirement ID | Requirement      | Test Case ID | Status  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| R1             | Login with email | TC1, TC2     | Passed  |
| R2             | Add to cart      | TC3          | Failed  |
| R3             | Payment          | TC4          | Pending |

This table ensures no requirement is missed.

---

 ✅ Maintaining Requirement Traceability

 What does maintaining mean?

Keeping the TRACEABILITY updated whenever:

* A new requirement comes
* Old requirement changes
* Test cases change
* New functionality is added

 Analogy

You keep updating your monthly budget when you spend or earn money.
If you don’t update, you will get confused where money went.

 Real-Time Example

If “Track Order” feature changes to “Track Order with ETA,”
👉 Update: Design → Development → Test Cases → RTM
Everything must be synced.

---

 ✅ Requirements Change

 What is a requirement change?

When the client modifies what they want.

 Analogy:

You ordered a small pizza.
Suddenly you change your mind and say:
“I need medium pizza with extra cheese.”

That’s a requirement change.

 Real-Time Example

Initially:
“Login using Email & Password”

Later client says:
“Add Login with Google also.”

This is requirement change.

---

 ✅ Change Management Process

This is a formal method to handle requirement changes without chaos.

 Steps (Very Simple)

1. Request → Client requests a change
2. Impact Analysis → Team checks how much time, cost & effort needed
3. Approval/Reject → Manager/client decides
4. Update Documents → SRS, design, test cases, RTM
5. Implement → Developers code
6. Test → Testers validate
7. Release → Final updated product delivered

 Analogy

When your teacher changes the exam syllabus:

* You check impact: “How much more to study?”
* Decide: “Should I prepare?”
* Update your notes
* Study
* Write exam
  Same steps!

---

 ✅ Requirement Creep (Scope Creep)

 What is Requirement Creep?

Small changes added continuously without proper planning.

👉 It slowly makes the project big, complicated, and delayed.

 Analogy

You go to a restaurant and order:

“I want dosa.”
Then you say:
“Add chutney.”
“Add sambar.”
“Add masala.”
“Add cheese.”
“Make it extra crispy.”
😂 The order keeps expanding.

This is scope creep.

 Real-Time Example

Building a website:
Initial requirement: “3 pages.”
Soon client says:

* Add blog
* Add chatbot
* Add analytics
* Add user login
* Add dark mode
* Add payment

Slowly the project explodes.
